# Machine-Learning
Learning systems can be used in many different ways in information systems. They can help finding rules of behavior for a given environments, aid the user finding an explanation for a particular phenomena, and used for predicting and analyzing data in any given domain. In this course we study varies neural networks, genetic algorithms and vector machines.
